Let's go through the **line-by-line execution** of your Python code, including memory updates and the values of variables at each step.

---

### **Given Code:**
```python
arr = [35, 12]
if len(arr) < 2:
    print(-1)
else:
    largest = -1
    sl = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):  
        if arr[i] > largest:
            largest = arr[i]
    for s in range(len(arr)):  
        if arr[s] < largest and arr[s] > sl:
            sl = arr[s]
    print(sl)
```

---

## **Step-by-Step Execution:**
#### **Step 1:** Initialize `arr`
```python
arr = [35, 12]
```
Memory state:
```
arr = [35, 12]
```

#### **Step 2:** Check if `len(arr) < 2`
```python
if len(arr) < 2:
    print(-1)
```
- The length of `arr` is `2`, so `len(arr) < 2` is **False**.
- The program **skips** the `print(-1)` statement and moves to the `else` block.

#### **Step 3:** Initialize variables
```python
largest = -1
sl = -1
```
Memory state:
```
arr = [35, 12]
largest = -1
sl = -1
```

#### **Step 4:** First loop - Find the largest number
```python
for i in range(len(arr)):  
    if arr[i] > largest:
        largest = arr[i]
```
- **Iteration 1 (`i = 0`)**:
  - `arr[0] = 35`
  - `35 > -1` ‚Üí `largest = 35`
  
Memory state:
```
largest = 35
```

- **Iteration 2 (`i = 1`)**:
  - `arr[1] = 12`
  - `12 > 35` is **False**, so `largest` remains **35**.

Final value:
```
largest = 35
```

---

#### **Step 5:** Second loop - Find second largest (sl)
```python
for s in range(len(arr)):  
    if arr[s] < largest and arr[s] > sl:
        sl = arr[s]
```
- **Iteration 1 (`s = 0`)**:
  - `arr[0] = 35`
  - `35 < 35` is **False**, so the condition fails.
  - `sl` remains **-1**.

- **Iteration 2 (`s = 1`)**:
  - `arr[1] = 12`
  - `12 < 35` ‚Üí **True**
  - `12 > -1` ‚Üí **True**
  - **Both conditions are True**, so `sl = 12`

Memory state:
```
sl = 12
```

---

#### **Step 6:** Print the second largest number
```python
print(sl)
```
- The value of `sl` is `12`, so **output**:
```
12
```

---

## **Final Output:**
```
12
```

### **Key Observations:**
1. The **largest number** found is `35`.
2. The **second largest number** found is `12`.
3. If there were only one number in the list, it would print `-1` (but not in this case).
4. The logic correctly finds the second largest number.

Good question! Let's clarify how the loop works and why `i = 1` in the second iteration.

### **Understanding the First Loop (`for i in range(len(arr))`):**
```python
for i in range(len(arr)):  
    if arr[i] > largest:
        largest = arr[i]
```
- `range(len(arr))` generates indices from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`.
- Since `arr = [35, 12]`, its length is `2`, so `range(len(arr))` produces **[0, 1]**.
- This means the loop runs **twice** with `i = 0` in the first iteration and `i = 1` in the second iteration.

---

### **Iteration Breakdown:**
1. **Iteration 1 (`i = 0`)**:
   - `arr[0] = 35`
   - Condition: `35 > -1` ‚Üí ‚úÖ True
   - Update: `largest = 35`

2. **Iteration 2 (`i = 1`)**:
   - `arr[1] = 12`
   - Condition: `12 > 35` ‚Üí ‚ùå False
   - No update to `largest`, it remains `35`.

Thus, in the **second iteration**, `i = 1` because the loop follows the index sequence `[0, 1]` based on `range(len(arr))`.
